# Put this anywhere on your $PATH (~/bin is recommended). Then git will see it
# and you'll be able to do `git churn`.
#
# Show churn for whole repo:
#   $ git churn
#
# Show churn for specific directories:
#   $ git churn app lib
#
# Show churn for a time range:
#   $ git churn --since='1 month ago'
#
# (These are all standard arguments to `git log`.)
